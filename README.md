## Abstract

The rising need for effective waste management and renewable energy has driven research into predicting biogas production at wastewater treatment plants. This study outlines a process starting with data collection from an operational plant, followed by detailed analysis to resolve potential issues. A notable advancement is the use of a robust machine learning model, fine-tuned with advanced optimization techniques. To enhance its utility, prediction intervals were incorporated to quantify uncertainty, supporting regulators in making informed decisions. The model performed well, explaining 82% of the variability in test data and delivering predictions closely aligned with actual biogas production. This reliability empowers more confident decision-making in wastewater treatment operations. The study also identified key factors influencing biogas output, including sludge characteristics, operational practices, and sludge quantity. By focusing on these variables, operators can optimize processes and significantly improve biogas yields. This predictive capability, combined with an understanding of influencing factors and quantified reliability, offers notable advantages. It enables operators to enhance plant efficiency and biogas production while providing regulators with reliable predictions to guide policy and resource management. These developments contribute to more sustainable and efficient waste management practices.
